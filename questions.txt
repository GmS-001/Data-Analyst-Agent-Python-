Scrape the list of highest grossing films from Wikipedia at the URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films.
    Create a pandas DataFrame from the main table.
    Clean the 'Worldwide gross' column to be a numeric float and the 'Year' column to be a numeric integer.
    Finally, use the `answer_generator` tool to print a JSON object with two keys:
    1. "movies_over_2.5_billion": The integer number of movies that grossed over $2.5 billion.
    2. "average_gross_2019": The average gross of movies released in 2019, as a float.
